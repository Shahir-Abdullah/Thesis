# Thesis
VLSI design & FPGA Implementation of â€œDesign of Approximate signed Multiplier for Error-Tolerant Applications"
This is my undergraduate thesis topic. 
My goal was to study floating point units and all the algorithms for designing fast FPUs. 

This project https://github.com/dawsonjon/fpu helped me a lot to understand the basic arithmatic units. 
This project helped me to understand pipeline design. https://github.com/dawsonjon/verilog-math
