# Thesis
VLSI design & FPGA Implementation of â€œDesign of Approximate signed Multiplier for Error-Tolerant Applications"
This is my undergraduate thesis topic. My goal was to study floating point units and all the algorithms for designing fast FPUs. This project helped me a lot to understand and learn about pipeline design.
